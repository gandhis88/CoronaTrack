## CoronaTrack

- Made using React Native 
- Main source code is Javascript


## TO RUN the app

- Drag and drop the 'app-release.apk' to the Android emulator.

--------------

#### To open Android project code
- Open the ./android folder using Android Studio


- Running the code from Android studio is a complicated process and requries 
all the npm react dependencies.

- The app is in React Native's release mode, so debug apk will not work, 
and the current Android studio configuration needs to be set to release. This 
is a problem when dealing with React Native projects.

- NOTE: There's some extra source code, We havent removed because of helper class dependency issue.
